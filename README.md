# Space Objects in Earth's Orbit
We chose a dataset focused on space objects such as satellites, rocket bodies, and space debris launched into Earth's orbit from the year 1961 to 2021. This topic has been motivated by increasingly global concern about space debris, its influence on the operations of satellites, and the long-term sustainability of Earth's orbits. 
# Challenges Faced 
One of the key challenges we encountered was working with the RCS_SIZE variable. As it is a categorical variable (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE), we tried to plot it initially using histograms and soon came to know that histogram plots were most appropriate for continuous numerical data. This made us move to bar plots and stacked bar plots, which are suitable to represent frequency distributions of categorical data. Another challenge was cleaning and filtering the data specifically handling missing values and categorizing orbits in relation to APOAPSIS, which was not labelled explicitly. 
# Changes from Original Plan 
We initially planned to create interactive visualizations or a Shiny dashboard. We then shifted our focus to creating individual static visualizations in the style of ggplot2 with sophisticated annotations. We then condensed the focus to highlight the main takeaways including accumulation trends, distribution of sizes, type of objects, and releases by country. 
# Proud work 
What we are most proud of is the total area plot demonstrating how Low Earth Orbit has become increasingly congested, specifically after 2010. It does a great job of demonstrating how the lower orbit is busiest and most exposed. We also appreciated how the stacked bar chart revealed the dominance of small debris and how object type (payloads, rocket bodies, TBA) branch out by size. 
# Improvements 
If we'd have had sufficient time, we'd have made the visual impact of the infographic better neater layouts, neater labels and legends, and adjusted themes. We'd have added additional countries to the launch comparison to have even better global insight. Lastly, we'd have attempted correlation analysis to have gained deeper context. 
# Final Thoughts 
This Project provided us with the opportunity to enhance our data cleaning, data aggregation, and R data visualizations skills. It further enhanced our knowledge of the growing issue of space pollution. We are grateful for the opportunity to take data from satellites and create insightful visualizations.
